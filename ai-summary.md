I learned that AI can be a valuable tool for understanding code and identifying bugs. However, when learning, I shouldn't ask directly for the solution even though AI will readily provide working code.

The key difference is context awareness: AI responds based solely on the text we provide, while the human brain can analyze the broader context and apply solutions that truly fit the specific situation we're working in.

This is the fundamental difference between human intelligence and AI - we must be careful not to blindly trust AI-generated code without understanding the context of our project.

- What kind of AI feedback helped you most: debugging, naming, or rewriting?
- What did you learn about *your own thinking* by reviewing this code?
- Did you rely too much on AI in any step? How could you improve?

It's tell me what is the bugs and how to solve it with the solution except if we tell thel to give us hints and not the solution directly.
I learned that i must analyse it, take a certain amount of time to think about it, and do it without AI first, then if i can't 
Then i will ask IA to help me if i'm not abble to solve the problem and ask it to explain me.
No, i think i'm improved somehow, but sometime i rlly to musch to AI
